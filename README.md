# pollsite

------------------------
Update after 1st commit:
I have some major difficulties with time management (pesky real life).
The site has only a bare bones login page and the database has no entrys.
But despite the pitiful state of the project I have confidence that I can do this.
------------------------


Site where users can make polls and participate on polls.

The site enables users to create polls that other registered users can vote on.
The polls can be multiple choice and can include open text fields for new voting options.
Users can select particular groups who can see their created polls.
Poll creators can set time sensitive expiry of their polls.
The site will have a mandatory login for users.
Site admin can freely edit and delete polls.
All the user data and poll data are stored in a sql database.
